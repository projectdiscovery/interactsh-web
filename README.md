# interactsh-web

[Interactsh-web](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh-web) is a free and open-source web client that displays [Interactsh](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh) interactions in a well-managed dashboard in your browser. It uses the **browser's local storage** to store and display interactions. By default, the web client is configured to use - **interachsh.com**, a cloud-hosted interactsh server, and supports other self-hosted public/authencaited interactsh servers as well.

A hosted instance of **interactsh-web** client is available at https://app.interactsh.com

```
interactsh-server -acao-url http://localhost:3000
```
</td>
